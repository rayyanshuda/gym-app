# 🏋️ Juggernaut Gym App

This is a personal project I made to help people (including myself) build gym workouts more easily. The app lets you:

- Pick what kind of workout plan you're into (individual muscle focus, bro split, bodybuilder-style, or upper/lower split)
- Choose the exact muscle groups you want to target
- Select your overall gym goal — whether that’s **strength & power**, **growth & hypertrophy**, or **cardiovascular endurance**

After making your picks, the app generates a complete workout plan for you. It also lets you **track how many sets you’ve completed**, and gives you detailed descriptions for each workout so you know what you're doing.

## 🛠 Built With

- **React** + **Vite** — for a fast, modern front-end
- **TailwindCSS** — to style everything clean and responsive
- **JavaScript** — to handle all the logic and state management

## 💡 Why I Made It

I wanted something lightweight and custom for my own gym routines, so I built this to quickly generate workouts based on what I felt like doing each day.
